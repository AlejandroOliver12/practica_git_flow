#### Pair Coding


Pair Coding
Pair coding specifies that there are two people working on the code at the same time and that as far as possible, they sit together. One is in charge of writing the code and the other of supervising in real time. At the same time they are constantly exchanging impressions. - Discuss problems, find solutions and develop creative ideas.

Good Practices In Pair Coding:
In practice this is usually a collaboration, this is usually a collaboration between two developers with different ranks, so a more experienced worker can pass on their knowledge to their younger colleagues directly through practice. On the other hand, a younger worker may come up with other ideas, perhaps more innovative, that they can contribute to the project.

The working method is very useful mainly for large projects. The “four eyes” principle is especially effective when you have to work with large amounts of code that also needs to be modified regularly. It ensures that the best possible version of a fragment will always be entered in the source text.
